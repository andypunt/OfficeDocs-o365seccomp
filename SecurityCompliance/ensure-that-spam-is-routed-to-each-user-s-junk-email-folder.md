# Ensure that spam is routed to each user's Junk Email folder

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This topic only applies to Exchange Online Protection (EOP) customers who host mailboxes on-premises in a hybrid deployment. Exchange Online customers whose mailboxes are fully-hosted in Office 365 do not need to run these commands. 
  
The default anti-spam action for EOP customers is to move spam messages to the recipients' Junk Email folder. In order for this action to work with on-premises mailboxes, you must configure Exchange mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) on your on-premises Edge or Hub servers to detect spam headers added by EOP. These mail flow rules set the spam confidence level (SCL) used by the SclJunkThreshold property of the Set-OrganizationConfig cmdlet to move spam into the Junk Email folder of each mailbox. 
  
### To add mail flow rules to ensure spam is moved to the Junk Email folder by using Windows PowerShell

1. Access the Exchange Management Shell for your on-premises Exchange server. To learn how to open the Exchange Management Shell in your on-premises Exchange organization, see **Open the Shell**.
    
2. Run the following command to route content-filtered spam messages to the Junk Email folder:
    
  ```Powershell
  New-TransportRule "NameForRule" -HeaderContainsMessageHeader "X-Forefront-Antispam-Report" -HeaderContainsWords "SFV:SPM" -SetSCL 6
  ```

*Where _NameForRule_ is the name for the new rule, for example, JunkContentFilteredMail.*
    
3. Run the following command to route messages marked as spam prior to reaching the content filter to the Junk Email folder:
    
  ```Powershell
  New-TransportRule "NameForRule" -HeaderContainsMessageHeader "X-Forefront-Antispam-Report" -HeaderContainsWords "SFV:SKS" -SetSCL 6
  ```

*Where  _NameForRule_ is the name for the new rule, for example, JunkMailBeforeReachingContentFilter.**
    
4. Run the following command to ensure that messages from senders in a block list in the spam filter policy, such as the **Sender block** list, are routed to the Junk Email folder: 
    
  ```Powershell
  New-TransportRule "NameForRule" -HeaderContainsMessageHeader "X-Forefront-Antispam-Report" -HeaderContainsWords "SFV:SKB" -SetSCL 6
  ```

*Where  _NameForRule_ is the name for the new rule, for example, JunkMailInSenderBlockList.**
    

> [!TIP]
> If you do not want to use the **Move message to Junk Email folder** action, you can choose another action in your content filter policies in the Exchange admin center. For more information, see [Configure your spam filter policies](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md). For more information about these fields in the message header, see [Anti-spam message headers](anti-spam-message-headers.md).
